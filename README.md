## Overview
This project demonstrates the application of CNNs for multi-label text classification tasks. It leverages GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) embeddings to convert words into numerical vectors, which are then fed into the CNN model.
## Dataset
The dataset used is multi-label text dataset with labels such as severe_toxicity, obscene, threat, insult, identity_attack, sexual_explicit.

## Results
- Accuracy: 98%
- F1 Score: 71%
- Precision: 78%
- Recall: 66%
